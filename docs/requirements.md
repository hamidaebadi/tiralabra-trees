In this project I decided to focus on comparing different
types of Tree data structures. Tree data structures play
important roles in practical problems solvings. Trees have
been used, for instances, in file systems, database designs
and so on. 

The important fact is to use a lanuage where using built-in data types
won't affect the project main focus. C/C++ provides reliable features
to measure and compare Tree data structures.

In this project I will focus on comparing four types of 
tree data structures.
 
 * Binary Tree
 * AVL Tree
 * Red-Black Tree
 * B-Tree

As we are going to test and measure the efficiency of various trees,
we need to provide sample data as input to our trees. After providing input,
we can apply different operations on trees and compare the evaluated resulst.
Basically we are going to measure how efficient those operations could be
on different types of tree data structures.
